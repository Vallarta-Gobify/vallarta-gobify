The Dashboard is organized into sections that provide immediate insights into your system's data:

1. **KPI Cards**: Key Performance Indicators showing critical statistics
2. **Quick Actions**: Fast access to frequently used features
3. **Trend Indicators**: Visual representation of data changes over time

## Understanding KPI Cards

KPI (Key Performance Indicator) cards display important statistics about your social programs, citizens, and reports.

## Reading Trend Indicators

Trend indicators help you understand whether metrics are improving, declining, or staying stable.

### Trend Arrow Colors

| Color | Arrow | Meaning | Typical Interpretation |
|-------|-------|---------|----------------------|
| Green | ↑ | Increasing | Positive growth |
| Red | ↓ | Decreasing | Declining numbers |
| Gray | → | Stable | Consistent, no major change |
| Blue | ↑ | Increasing | May indicate higher workload |

### Context Matters

Not all upward trends are positive and not all downward trends are negative:

**Positive Upward Trends:**
- More beneficiaries enrolled in programs
- More programs activated
- Higher completion rates

**Positive Downward Trends:**
- Fewer pending reports (better processing)
- Reduced processing time
- Fewer errors or rejections

**Concerning Upward Trends:**
- Increasing pending items
- Growing backlog
- Rising complaint rates

**Concerning Downward Trends:**
- Decreasing program enrollment
- Fewer active programs
- Reduced citizen engagement

## Time Periods

Trend percentages typically compare:
- Current period vs. previous period
- This month vs. last month
- This quarter vs. last quarter

**To See Details:**
- Hover your mouse over the percentage to see the comparison period
- Some cards may have a small info icon (i) you can click for more details

## Navigating from Dashboard
